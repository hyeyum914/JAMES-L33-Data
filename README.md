# JAMES-Vertical_Resolution

This directory includes reanalysis and model output datasets used to generate figures in the paper entitled 
"Improved Surface Layer Simulation Using Refined Vertical Resolution in the GFDL Atmospheric General Circulation Model",
which is published in JAMES.

1. reanalysis-t2m.tar and reanalysis-u10m.tar: 10-year climatologies of daily mean/min/max T2 and U10 from reanalysis ensemble dataset.
2. L33-t2m.tar and L33-u10m.tar: 10-year climatologies of daily mean/minimum/maximum T2 and U10 from L33 simulation.
3. L32-t2m.tar and L32-u10m.tar: 10-year climatologies of daily mean/minimum/maximum T2 and U10 from L32 simulation.
4. offline.tar: Offline model output (ws - weakly stable case, vs - very stable case, ts - transition stability case).
